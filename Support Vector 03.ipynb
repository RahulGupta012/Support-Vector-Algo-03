    "The SVM Regression model, which means Support Vector Meachine Regression model is known for distniguishing the data points into the categories by the hyper plain such that the dependent faeture can be predicted. For calculating the accuracy and finding the error in this distribution can be done by sevral ways. These ways to calculating the performance of the SVM regression model are shown below :\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Squred Error (MSE)** : It is used for Calculating the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. In this method equation is also differentiable but in such a case of Bengaluru_House_dataset, when there are so many outliers in the dependent feature ; 'Price' . It is not so suitable to use as it has no any feature of rebusting Outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** : MAE is similler to the mse, However it has some feature which are not in the MSE , as it is rebusting the outliers . Which is good for our Bengaluru_House_dataset , where are many outliers it(MAE) is good to use. There are one more advantage of MSE, that it always be in a same unit. However it takes more time as our data set has too big (it has 13339 entries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rout Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** : RMSE is just a square root of MSE . It can also be proved as a benificial for calculating the performance of the model of Begaluru_House_Dataset as RMSE can be sensitive to outliers. Outliers with large errors can significantly impact the RMSE value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R square and Adjusted Rsquare** :can also be a option but R 2 is sensitive to the scale of the dependent variable, and it may not be a good metric for models with categorical outcomes. It always ranges between 0 to 1. with 1 being a perfect fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Point to note that MSE , MAE and RMSE are the error values of the model so if these values are higher, it convet the bad indicator as the accuracy of the model is low. and in the case of R Square , the value is the magnitude of accuracy so higher R square means higher accuracy of the model.
